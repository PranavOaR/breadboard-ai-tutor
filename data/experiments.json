      "Breadboard Structure": "Two main areas: terminal strips (center) and power rails (sides). Terminal strips: 5 holes per row (a-e) connected horizontally, separated by center gap. Rows are independent vertically.",
      "Power Rails": "Two vertical strips per side: positive (+, red) and negative (-, blue/black). All holes in same rail connected vertically. Left and right rails independent unless bridged.",
      "Center Gap": "Divides breadboard for IC placement. IC straddles gap with pins on both sides. No electrical connection across gap."

      "Assuming all holes in a column are connected (only rows are connected)",

      "Inserting components too shallow (not making contact)",
      "Using both sides of gap as single row (will short circuit some designs)"

    "troubleshooting": [
      "Test shows unexpected results: Component legs may not be fully inserted",
      "All tests fail: Check power supply connection to rails",
      "Some positions work, others don't: Breadboard may have damaged internal connections",
      "LEDs in same row show different brightness: Unequal resistance in connections, re-insert firmly",
      "Power rails not working: Ensure jumpers properly connect supply to rails"

      "Always disconnect power before inserting or removing components",

# Breadboard AI Tutor – Sample Outputs

## Question: Why is my LED not glowing?

Tutor Answer:
- Flip the LED polarity (anode/cathode may be reversed)
- Ensure the resistor is connected in series
- Verify the battery rails are powered correctly

## Question: What does a resistor do?

Tutor Answer:
A resistor limits current to protect components like LEDs from burning out.

## Question: Explain LED Glow with Resistor experiment

Tutor Answer:
1. Insert LED correctly (long leg = anode)
2. Connect resistor from cathode to ground
3. Connect battery to rails
4. LED should glow steadily

## Question: How does a push button work?

Tutor Answer:
A push button acts as a switch that completes the circuit only when pressed.

## Question: What is an LDR?

Tutor Answer:
An LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) changes resistance based on light intensity.

## Question: What are common mistakes with buzzers?

Tutor Answer:
- Wrong buzzer polarity
- Using a passive buzzer without signal input

---

## Question: What is a breadboard rail?

Tutor Answer:
Breadboard rails are vertical power columns used to distribute + and − voltage.

---

## Question: How does a transistor switch an LED?

Tutor Answer:
A transistor acts as an electronic switch where a small base current controls a larger collector-emitter current.

---

## Question: What happens in series vs parallel LEDs?

Tutor Answer:
Parallel LEDs glow brighter than series LEDs at the same voltage.

---

## Question: How do I test continuity with an LED?

Tutor Answer:
The LED lights only when the electrical path is complete, showing continuity.
